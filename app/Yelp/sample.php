 * Yelp API v2.0 code sample.
 *
 * This program demonstrates the capability of the Yelp API version 2.0
 * by using the Search API to query for businesses by a search term and location,
 * and the Business API to query additional information about the top result
 * from the search query.
 * 
 * Please refer to http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation for the API documentation.

 * found here:
 *      http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/
 * 
 * Sample usage of the program:
 * `php sample.php --term="bars" --location="San Francisco, CA"`
