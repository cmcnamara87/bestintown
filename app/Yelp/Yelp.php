         * term	string	optional	Search term (e.g. "food", "restaurants"). If term isnâ€™t included we search everything.
        limit	number	optional	Number of business results to return
        offset	number	optional	Offset the list of returned business results by this amount
        sort	number	optional	Sort mode: 0=Best matched (default), 1=Distance, 2=Highest Rated. If the mode is 1 or 2 a search may retrieve an additional 20 businesses past the initial limit of the first 20 results. This is done by specifying an offset and limit of 20. Sort by distance is only supported for a location or geographic search. The rating sort is not strictly sorted by the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of ratings, similar to a bayesian average. This is so a business with 1 rating of 5 stars doesnâ€™t immediately jump to the top.
        category_filter	string	optional	Category to filter search results with. See the list of supported categories. The category filter can be a list of comma delimited categories. For example, 'bars,french' will filter by Bars and French. The category identifier should be used (for example 'discgolf', not 'Disc Golf').
        radius_filter	number	optional	Search radius in meters. If the value is too large, a AREA_TOO_LARGE error may be returned. The max value is 40000 meters (25 miles).
        deals_filter	bool	optional	Whether to exclusively search for businesses with deals
